# Manipulate: `tidyr`, `dplyr`

> Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information. - [NYTimes (2014)](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html)

Today we're going to learn about a package by Hadley Wickham called `dplyr` and how it will help you with simple data exploration, and how you can use it in combination with the `%>%` operator for more complex wrangling (including a lot of the things you would use for loops for. 

And we're going to do this in Rmarkdown in the `my-project` repository we created this morning. 

Here are the steps:

1. Open RStudio
1. Make sure you're in your `my-project` repo (and if not, get there)
1. New > Rmarkdown... (defaults are fine)
1. Save as `gapminder-dplyr.rmd`
1. Our workflow together will be to write some description of our analysis in Markdown for humans to read, and we will write all of our R code in the 'chunks'. Get ready for the awesomeness, here we go...

Today's materials are again borrowing from some excellent sources, including

- Dr. Jenny Bryan's lectures from STAT545 at UBC: [Introduction to dplyr](http://stat545.com/block009_dplyr-intro.html)
- Software Carpentry's R for reproducible scientific analysis materials: [Dataframe manipulation with dplyr](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/13-dplyr.html)

## install our first package: `dplyr`

Packages are bundles of functions, along with help pages and other goodies that make them easier for others to use, (ie. vignettes). 

So far we've been using packages included in 'base R'; they are 'out-of-the-box' functions. You can also install packages from online. The most traditional is [CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/). This is where you went to download R originally, and will go again to look for updates. 

You don't need to go to CRAN's website to install packages, we can do it from within R with the command `install.packages("package-name-in-quotes")`.
```{r}
## from CRAN:
#install.packages("dplyr") ## do this once only to install the package on your computer.

library(dplyr) ## do this every time you restart R and need it
select <- dplyr::select # overwrite raster::select
```
What's the difference between `install.packages()` and `library()`? Here's my analogy: 

- `install.packages()` is setting up electricity for your house. Just need to do this once (let's ignore monthly bills). 
- `library()` is turning on the lights. You only turn them on when you need them, otherwise it wouldn't be efficient. And when you quit R, and come back, you'll have to turn them on again with `library()`, but you already have your electricity set up.

## Use `dplyr::filter()` to subset data row-wise.

First let's read in the gapminder data. 
```{r}
# install.packages('gapminder') # instead of reading in the csv
library(gapminder) # this is the package name
str(gapminder) # and it's also the data.frame name, just like yesterday
```

`filter()` takes logical expressions and returns the rows for which all are `TRUE`. Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 

![](figs/rstudio-cheatsheet-filter.png)

```{r eval=FALSE}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 29)
filter(gapminder, country == "Rwanda")
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```

Compare with some base R code to accomplish the same things
```{r eval = FALSE}
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp < 29, ] ## repeat `gapminder`, [i, j] indexing is distracting
subset(gapminder, country == "Rwanda") ## almost same as filter ... but wait ...
```

## Meet the new pipe operator

Before we go any further, we should exploit the new pipe operator that `dplyr` imports from the [`magrittr`](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) package by Stefan Bache. **This is going to change your data analytical life**. You no longer need to enact multi-operation commands by nesting them inside each other. This new syntax leads to code that is much easier to write and to read.

Here's what it looks like: `%>%`. The RStudio keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows), Cmd + Shift + M (Mac).

Let's demo then I'll explain:
```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% head
```

This is equivalent to `head(gapminder)`. This pipe operator takes the thing on the left-hand-side and __pipes__ it into the function call on the right-hand-side -- literally, drops it in as the first argument.

Never fear, you can still specify other arguments to this function! To see the first 3 rows of Gapminder, we could say `head(gapminder, 3)` or this:
```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% head(3)
```

**I've advised you to think "gets" whenever you see the assignment operator, `<-`. Similary, you should think "then" whenever you see the pipe operator, `%>%`.**

You are probably not impressed yet, but the magic will soon happen.

## Use `dplyr::select()` to subset the data on variables or columns.

Back to `dplyr` ...

Use `select()` to subset the data on variables or columns. Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 

![](figs/rstudio-cheatsheet-select.png)

Here's a conventional call:

```{r eval=FALSE}
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp) 
```

But using what we just learned, with a pipe, we can do this:
```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% select(year, lifeExp)
```

Let's write it again but using multiple lines so it's nicer to read. And let's add a second pipe operator to pipe through `head`:
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  select(year, lifeExp) %>%
  head(4)
```
Think: "Take `gapminder`, then select the variables year and lifeExp, then show the first 4 rows."

## Revel in the convenience
Let's do a little analysis where we calculate the mean gdp for Cambodia. 

Here's the gapminder data for Cambodia, but only certain variables:
```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  # select(country, year, pop, gdpPercap) ## entering 4 of the 6 columns is tedious
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) # you can use - to deselect columns
```

and what a typical base R call would look like:

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$country == "Cambodia", c("country", "year", "pop", "gdpPercap")]
```

or, possibly?, a nicer look using base R's `subset()` function:

```{r}
subset(gapminder, country == "Cambodia", select = c(country, year, pop, gdpPercap))
```

## Use `mutate()` to add new variables

Imagine we wanted to recover each country's GDP. After all, the Gapminder data has a variable for population and GDP per capita. Let's add a new column and multiply them together.

Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 

![](figs/rstudio-cheatsheet-mutate.png)

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

> Exercise: how would you add that to the previous `filter` and `select` commands we did with Cambodia:
```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(-continent, -lifeExp)
```

Answer: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

## `group_by` and `summarize`
Great! And now we want to calculate the mean gdp across all years (Let's pretend that's a good idea statistically) 

Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 
 
![](figs/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png)

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp = mean(gdp)) %>%
  ungroup() # if you use group_by, also use ungroup() to save heartache later
```

## Remember our for loop?

And how would you then do this for every country, not just Cambodia? Well, yesterday we would have been thinking about putting this whole analysis inside a for loop, replacing "Cambodia" with a new name each time we iterated through the loop. But today, we have it already, just need to *delete* one line from our analysis--we don't need to filter out Cambodia anymore!! 

Visually, we are doing this (thanks RStudio for your [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)): 
 
![](figs/rstudio-cheatsheet-group_by.png)

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp = mean(gdp)) %>%
  ungroup() # if you use group_by, also use ungroup() to save heartache later
```

So we have done a pretty incredible amount of work in a few lines. Our whole analysis is this. Imagine the possibilities from here. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

gapminder %>% 
  read.csv('data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv') %>% 
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp = mean(gdp)) %>%
  ungroup() # if you use group_by, also use ungroup() to save heartache later
```

## Summary

This has been the 'Tranform' or Wrangling part of this cycle.

Importing and tidying is also a HUGE part of this process, and we don't have time to get into it today. But look at the cheatsheet, and watch the webinar. [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) and [webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/data-wrangling-with-r-and-rstudio/). Watch this 1 hour webinar and follow along in RStudio and your science will be forever changed. Again!

### Rationale 

When performing data analysis in R, code can become quite messy, making it hard to revisit and determine the sequence of operations. Commenting helps. Good variable names help. Still, at least two common issues make code difficult to understand: **multiple variables** and **nested functions**. Let's examine these issues by approaching an analysis presenting both problems, and finally see how `dplyr` offers an elegant alternative.

For example, let's ask of the `surveys.csv` dataset: _**How many observations of a certain thing you're interested in appear each year?**_

### Pseudocode

You can write the logic out as **pseudocode** which can become later comments for the actual code:

```{r pseudocode, eval=F}
# read in csv
# view data
# limit columns to species and year
# limit rows to just species "NL"
# get count per year
# write out csv
```

### Summary

The `tidyr` and `dplyr` packages were created by [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) of `ggplot2` fame. The "gg" in `ggplot2` stands for the "grammar of graphics". Hadley similarly considers the functionality of the two packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` to provide the "grammar of data manipulation".

Next, we'll explore the data wrangling lessons that [Remi contributed](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/commits?author=remi-daigle) to Software Carpentry.
